TimeFreeze
==========

Super simple library for freezing time consistently and without any dependencies

  TimeFreeze.freeze!(Time.mktime(2001,12,30,13,45)) do
    Time.now     # => "30th December 2001, 13:45"
    Date.today   # => "30th December 2001"
    DateTime.now # => "30th December 2001, 13:45"
  end
  
Or for convenience you can use Time.freeze! rather than TimeFreeze.freeze!

  Time.freeze!(Time.mktime(2001,12,30,13,45)) do
    Time.now     # => "30th December 2001, 13:45"
    Date.today   # => "30th December 2001"
    DateTime.now # => "30th December 2001, 13:45"
  end
  
The code is simple and clean,
and is error tolerant,
no fears that the time will not be reset afterwards.
